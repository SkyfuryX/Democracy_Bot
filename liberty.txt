Democracy fills my sample container!
My Leg! For the love of liberty, my leg!
Say hello to DEMOCRACY!
Howâ€™d you like the Taste of Freedom?
How 'bout a nice cup of LIBER-TEA?
Freedom never sleeps!
To the skies!
Freedom won't be given to us, we have to earn it!
REINFORCING!
Injury? What injury!
If At First You Don't Succeed, Dive, Dive Again.
Freedom delivery!
Prosperity, Liberty, Democracy... Our way of life.
Victory or death! Preferably victory, though.
I like fighting bugs!
GET SOME!
For SUPER EARTH!
Ready for another mission, helldiver?
The people of Super Earth look to us for hope.\nWe will deliver it - one enemy corpse at a time.
Remain ever-vigilant for deceit and treachery.\nThey can take root in the smallest of cracks.
MOTHER of LIBERTY!
